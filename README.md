# fcc: Calculator

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Dominic-Mikelis/pen/BaPXppe](https://codepen.io/Dominic-Mikelis/pen/BaPXppe).

Live demo shows code compiled through Codepen's export; code as I edited it can be reviewed in the codepen-src folder.

All interactable elements are written within the Calculator React class;
    Direct-to-display functions such as typing a number or simple arithmetic operation are created through a filter loop;
    Unique actions, such as clearing the screen, generating final output or more complex operations are defined separately.

The FCC task required the minus (-) button to also behave as a negative sign; this functionality still exists but the Â± key works as a better method that can also turn numbers positive again.

Styling uses Sass to allow for more concise grid area assignment.
